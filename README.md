It seems like you have a well-structured roadmap ahead of you! Here's a step-by-step guide to get started:

1. **Python Basics**:
   - Start with learning Python basics such as syntax, data types, control structures, and functions. You can find plenty of free resources online, like tutorials and courses on platforms like Codecademy, Coursera, or Udemy.

2. **Statistical Analysis and Mathematics**:
   - Begin with statistics fundamentals, covering probability, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis. Resources like Khan Academy, Coursera, or textbooks like "Introduction to Statistical Learning" can be helpful.
   - Proceed to learn basics of linear algebra, focusing on matrices, vectors, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. Khan Academy and MIT OpenCourseWare offer excellent resources for this.
   - Study calculus, particularly derivatives and integrals. Again, Khan Academy and MIT OpenCourseWare can be useful here.

3. **Data Manipulation and Analysis**:
   - Dive into Pandas for data manipulation and analysis in Python. Start with the official documentation and then practice with datasets available on platforms like Kaggle or GitHub.
   - Learn NumPy for numerical computing. There are many tutorials and guides available online to help you grasp its functionalities.
   - Understand SQL for querying and managing databases. W3Schools and Mode Analytics offer beginner-friendly SQL tutorials.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Begin with Matplotlib for creating static visualizations in Python. Explore the official documentation and tutorials.
   - Move on to Seaborn for more advanced statistical visualizations. Again, the official documentation and tutorials will be beneficial.

5. **Machine Learning**:
   - Start with scikit-learn for traditional machine learning algorithms. The scikit-learn documentation provides comprehensive explanations and examples.
   - Choose either TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning. Begin with introductory tutorials and gradually move to more advanced topics.

6. **Big Data Tools**:
   - Learn Apache Spark for large-scale data processing. Start with the official documentation and online tutorials.
   - Understand the basics of Hadoop for distributed storage and processing. Resources like Hadoop's official documentation and tutorials can be helpful.

7. **Version Control**:
   - Master Git for collaborative development and version control. Start with basic Git commands and gradually explore more advanced features.

8. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Learn regular expressions for text processing and pattern matching. There are many tutorials available online to get you started.
   - Study data cleaning techniques such as handling missing values and outlier detection. Books like "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney can be helpful.

9. **Communication and Presentation**:
   - Develop skills in data storytelling to effectively communicate insights. Practice presenting your findings to different audiences.
   - Familiarize yourself with visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI. Many tutorials and guides are available online for these tools.

10. **Domain Knowledge**:
    - Depending on your interests, delve into domain-specific knowledge relevant to your field of interest. Look for online courses, books, or resources specific to the domain you're interested in.

11. **Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking**:
    - Practice problem-solving and critical thinking skills by working on real-world data science problems. Participate in Kaggle competitions, work on personal projects, and collaborate with others in the data science community.

Remember, consistency and practice are key. Break down your learning into manageable chunks, and don't hesitate to seek help from online communities or mentors along the way. Good luck on your journey into data science!
Continuous Learning:
Stay updated with the latest advancements in data science by following blogs, attending conferences, and participating in online courses or communities.
Remember, it's not necessary to master all of these tools and skills immediately. Start with the fundamentals and gradually build upon them as you progress in your studies and projects. Additionally, practical experience through internships, personal projects, and Kaggle competitions can greatly enhance your learning.
